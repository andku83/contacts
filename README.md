INSTALLATION
------------

### Install from an Archive File


### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
git clone https://github.com/andku83/contacts.git
composer install
~~~

~~~
yii migrate
yii serve
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `contacts` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost:8080/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\db\Connection',
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2_contacts',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'charset' => 'utf8',
];
```

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
